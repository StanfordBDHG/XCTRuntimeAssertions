Test assertions and preconditions.


## Overview

This library provides the necessary runtime support to support unit testing assertions and preconditions.
The library overloads Swifts runtime assertions:
* `assert(_:_:file:line:)`
* `assertionFailure(_:file:line:)`
* `precondition(_:_:file:line:)`
* `preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)`

Always call this method in your System under Test.
Only if requested within a unit test, their implementations are swapped to assert a runtime assertion.
Release builds will completely optimize out this runtime support library and direct calls to the original Swift implementation.

### Configure your System under Test

To configure your System under Test, you just need to import the `RuntimeAssertion` library and call your runtime assertions functions as usual.

```swift
import RuntimeAssertions

func foo() {
    precondition(someFooCondition, "Foo condition is unmet.")
    // ...
}
```

### Testing Runtime Assertions

In your unit tests you can use the `expectRuntimeAssertion(expectedCount:_:assertion:sourceLocation:_:)` and
`expectRuntimePrecondition(timeout:_:precondition:sourceLocation:_:)` functions to test a block of code for which you expect
a runtime assertion to occur.

Below is a short code example demonstrating this for assertions:

```swift
import RuntimeAssertionsTesting
import Testing

@Test
func testAssertion() {
    expectRuntimeAssertion {
        // code containing a call to assert() of the runtime support ...
    }
}
```

Below is a short code example demonstrating this for preconditions:

```swift
import RuntimeAssertionsTesting
import Testing

@Test
func testPrecondition() {
    expectRuntimePrecondition {
        // code containing a call to precondition() of the runtime support ...
    }
}
```

> Tip: Both expectation methods also support the execution of `async` code.
