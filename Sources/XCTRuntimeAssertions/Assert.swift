#if DEBUG || TEST
/// Performs a traditional C-style assert with an optional message.
///
/// Use this function for internal sanity checks that are active during testing
/// but do not impact performance of shipping code. To check for invalid usage
/// in Release builds, see `precondition(_:_:file:line:)`.
///
/// * In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode's Debug
///   configuration): If `condition` evaluates to `false`, stop program
///   execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.
///
/// * In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode's Release configuration),
///   `condition` is not evaluated, and there are no effects.
///
/// * In `-Ounchecked` builds, `condition` is not evaluated, but the optimizer
///   may assume that it *always* evaluates to `true`. Failure to satisfy that
///   assumption is a serious programming error.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - condition: The condition to test. `condition` is only evaluated in
///     playgrounds and `-Onone` builds.
///   - message: A string to print if `condition` is evaluated to `false`. The
///     default is an empty string.
///   - file: The file name to print with `message` if the assertion fails. The
///     default is the file where `assert(_:_:file:line:)` is called.
///   - line: The line number to print along with `message` if the assertion
///     fails. The default is the line number where `assert(_:_:file:line:)`
///     is called.

/// Indicates that an internal sanity check failed.

/// This function's effect varies depending on the build flag used:
///
/// * In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode's Debug
///   configuration), stop program execution in a debuggable state after
///   printing `message`.
///
/// * In `-O` builds, has no effect.
///
/// * In `-Ounchecked` builds, the optimizer may assume that this function is
///   never called. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious
///   programming error.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - message: A string to print in a playground or `-Onone` build. The
///     default is an empty string.
///   - file: The file name to print with `message`. The default is the file
///     where `assertionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.
///   - line: The line number to print along with `message`. The default is the
///     line number where `assertionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.
