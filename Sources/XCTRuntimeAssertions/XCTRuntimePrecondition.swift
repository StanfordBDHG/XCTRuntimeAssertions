/// `XCTRuntimePrecondition` allows you to test assertions of types that use the `precondition` and `preconditionFailure` functions of the `XCTRuntimeAssertions` target.
///
/// - Important: The `expression` is executed on a background thread, even though it is not annotated as `@Sendable`. This is by design. Preconditions return `Never` and, therefore,
/// need to be run on a separate thread that can block forever. Without this workaround, testing preconditions that are isolated to `@MainActor` would be impossible.
/// Make sure to only run isolated parts of your code that don't suffer from concurrency issues in such a scenario.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - validateRuntimeAssertion: An optional closure that can be used to further validate the messages passed to the
///                               `precondition` and `preconditionFailure` functions of the `XCTRuntimeAssertions` target.
///   - timeout: A timeout defining how long to wait for the precondition to be triggered.
///   - message: A message that is posted on failure.
///   - file: The file where the failure occurs. The default is the filename of the test case where you call this function.
///   - line: The line number where the failure occurs. The default is the line number where you call this function.
///   - expression: The expression that is evaluated.
