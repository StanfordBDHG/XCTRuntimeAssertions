/// Checks a necessary condition for making forward progress.
///
/// Use this function to detect conditions that must prevent the program from
/// proceeding, even in shipping code.
///
/// * In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode's Debug
///   configuration): If `condition` evaluates to `false`, stop program
///   execution in a debuggable state after printing `message`.
///
/// * In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode's Release configuration): If
///   `condition` evaluates to `false`, stop program execution.
///
/// * In `-Ounchecked` builds, `condition` is not evaluated, but the optimizer
///   may assume that it *always* evaluates to `true`. Failure to satisfy that
///   assumption is a serious programming error.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - condition: The condition to test. `condition` is not evaluated in
///     `-Ounchecked` builds.
///   - message: A string to print if `condition` is evaluated to `false` in a
///     playground or `-Onone` build. The default is an empty string.
///   - file: The file name to print with `message` if the precondition fails.
///     The default is the file where `precondition(_:_:file:line:)` is
///     called.
///   - line: The line number to print along with `message` if the assertion
///     fails. The default is the line number where
///     `precondition(_:_:file:line:)` is called.

/// Indicates that a precondition was violated.
///
/// Use this function to stop the program when control flow can only reach the
/// call if your API was improperly used and execution flow is not expected to
/// reach the call---for example, in the `default` case of a `switch` where
/// you have knowledge that one of the other cases must be satisfied.
///
/// This function's effect varies depending on the build flag used:
///
/// * In playgrounds and `-Onone` builds (the default for Xcode's Debug
///   configuration), stops program execution in a debuggable state after
///   printing `message`.
///
/// * In `-O` builds (the default for Xcode's Release configuration), stops
///   program execution.
///
/// * In `-Ounchecked` builds, the optimizer may assume that this function is
///   never called. Failure to satisfy that assumption is a serious
///   programming error.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - message: A string to print in a playground or `-Onone` build. The
///     default is an empty string.
///   - file: The file name to print with `message`. The default is the file
///     where `preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.
///   - line: The line number to print along with `message`. The default is the
///     line number where `preconditionFailure(_:file:line:)` is called.
