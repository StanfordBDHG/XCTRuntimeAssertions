/// Test assertions that use `precondition` or `preconditionFailure` of the `RuntimeAssertions` library.

/// - Important: The `expression` is executed on a background thread, even though it is not annotated as `@Sendable`. This is by design. Preconditions return `Never` and, therefore,
/// need to be run on a separate thread that can block forever. Without this workaround, testing preconditions that are isolated to `@MainActor` would be impossible.
/// Make sure to only run isolated parts of your code that don't suffer from concurrency issues in such a scenario.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - timeout: A timeout defining how long to wait for the precondition to be triggered.
///   - comment: A comment describing the expectation.
///   - precondition: Validate and handle the contents of the precondition.
///   - sourceLocation: The source location to which recorded expectations and issues should be attributed.
///   - expression: The expression to be evaluated.
